            <p>This is a public service application created for free by <a href="http://www.zyxware.com" target="_blank">Zyxware Technologies</a> for Government of Kerala. The application helps to identify and track in realtime the occurence and spread of diseases, specifically the potent and the communicable ones, over the web. It uses an easy to use web based interface integrated with the display of the collected information on a navigable map. Using this software public authorities can identify trends and patterns in the spread of diseases and take timely remedial action. Additionally this system would make reporting of diseases by the hospitals to the District Medical officials much more easier, efficent and environment friendly(paper-less).
